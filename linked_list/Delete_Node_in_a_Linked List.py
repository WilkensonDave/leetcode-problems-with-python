# There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

# You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

# All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not 
# the last node in the linked list.

# Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

# The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
# The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
# All the values before node should be in the same order.
# All the values after node should be in the same order.
# Custom testing:

# For the input, you should provide the entire linked list head and the node to be given node. 
# ode should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
# We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
# The output will be the entire list after calling your function.
