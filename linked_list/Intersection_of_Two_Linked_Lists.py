# Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. 
# If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

# For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1:


# The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

# Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.

# Custom Judge:

# The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs):

# intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node.
# listA - The first linked list.
# listB - The second linked list.
# skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
# skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
# The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and
# headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted.


# Example 1:

# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Intersected at '8'
# Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
# From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. 
# There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
# - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node 
# in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. 
# In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, 
# while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
