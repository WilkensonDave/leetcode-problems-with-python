# Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, 
# return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, 
# or false otherwise.

# Example 1:

# Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
# Output: true
# Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
# push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
# pop() -> 4,
# push(5),
# pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
# Example 2:

# Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
# Output: false
# Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
